# Katalin Berlow — Website (GitHub Pages template)

This folder is a **static website** (HTML + CSS) intended to be dropped into a GitHub Pages repo.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a repo named: `YOURUSERNAME.github.io`
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the repo root.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`

Your site will appear at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io`.

## What to customize
- `index.html`
  - Replace placeholder links for Scholar/GitHub.
  - Update the research pitch if desired.
- `CV.pdf`
  - Put your CV PDF in the repo root with this exact filename.
- `assets/me.jpg`
  - Put your headshot here (or change the path in `index.html`).
- Optional: set `og:image` in the `<head>` once you have a share image.

## Notes
- If you don't use Jekyll, you can add an empty `.nojekyll` file in the repo root.
- Keep links to PDFs consistent with file names.
